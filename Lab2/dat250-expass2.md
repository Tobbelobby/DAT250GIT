# Second Lab

## Intro 


For the second lab we set up a database with Java Persistence API.
We were to implement the domain model that was given.

## Problems 

I did not have any problems whit the tools, for inspecting the database i used derby database server.
But after seeing the use of IDE plug in, i changed my IDE to IntelliJ.
The small problems i had was do to path, and was solved by setting the correct paths.

As you can see i inspect the db through the tool in IntelliJ.
